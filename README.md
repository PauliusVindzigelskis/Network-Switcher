## What is it for?

Switch between active network configurations without unplugging cables. Useful when You have private connection and public connection at same time - for example private intranet LAN and public WIFI at workplace.

## How it works? 

Well.. It only changes connection priorities in network settings by resorting connection identifiers. You can track list by going to Preferences -> Network.

## Why is it asking for admin access?

Mac won't let You just change network settings without your permission. It will lose permission right after quitting app, so next time launching app, OS will ask again. 

P. S. No need to enter password each time when switching connections - only at app start up.
